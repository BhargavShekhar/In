                <h1>the Absolute Being</h1>
                <p>He is on a king's pedestal, looking over everyone else. He is also massive, making everything else pale in comparison.<br>
                When awake, his eyes light up red and his lips peel back to show a row of sharp teeth. His smile is sinister and terror inducing, enough to make the hunters who first saw him quake in fear.

        <p>Okay, so basically, I just watched Solo Leveling and liked it very much. I thought, why not create an invitation card so that others can also enjoy it? Tell me how you liked it:)</p>
